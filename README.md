Working on Trackmania2020 and TrackmaniaÂ²

### Behavior:

- When a player join the server, if the whitelist is activated and the player is not in the whitelist, he will be kicked from the server
- When an admin activate the whitelist, all players not in the whitelist will be kicked
- If the whitelist is already activated, if you remove a player from the whitelist he will be kicked, if you clear everyone will be kicked.  
  ! Players with admin roles are considered whitelisted even if they are not in the whitelist !

### Commands(if you prefer to use commands) :

`//whitelist` Show the whitelist window.  
`//wl help` Show available whitelist commands in the chat.  
`//wl add` _Parameter: player login or nickname._

### Known bugs:

- The input of a manialink accept a maximum of 1024 characters(Nadeo limitation I guess) and there's no attribute to limit the number of characters.
  The manialink crash when we exceed the limit
